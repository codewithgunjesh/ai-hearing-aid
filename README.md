# AI-Powered Hearing Aid Using Deep Learning
AI-powered hearing aid for real-time noise reduction and speech enhancement.

This repository is a collection of software designed for a hearing aid system that leverages deep learning for **real-time speech de-noising**. The system is intended to run on an **NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB** and interfaces with an earpiece via the standard headphone and microphone jacks.

##  Objective

Enable a low-latency, real-time audio enhancement pipeline that removes background noise from speech using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN).

---

##  Hardware Platform

- Jetson Nano 2GB
- Microphone and Headphone jacks
- External or onboard microphone

---

##  Processing Pipeline

The system processes audio in the following stages:

1. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
2. Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)
3. Inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (ISTFT)
